  <h3>Kyrel Jerome</h3>
  <p> Hi! I’m Kyrel, an incoming fourth year computer science student, and this year I’ll be President of the UTM Robotics club. Also a mentor for multiple FIRST robotics teams, I am particularly interested in computer vision, simulated modelling, and path planning. We’re all extremely excited to bring new robotics opportunities to UTM!</p>

  <h3>Laura M Madrid</h3>
  <p> Hey Everyone, my name is Laura and I’m a second year computer science student and the VP Events Coordinator of UTM Robotics! I find soldering relaxing and I really enjoy working on projects that are fun and can help others! I also like to play soccer in my spare time! Feel free to reach out! </p>
  
  <p> I love connecting with others and believe that I would be fit for the Events Coordinator position. During my summer Internship at Microsoft, as a Product Marketing Manager Intern, I learned many valuable skills like collaborating with others to materialize great ideas, and learned to speak in front of 500 people to introduce the app that we did with my colleagues. I hope that I can bring these skills to the robotics clubs, to work with other organizations like the HackLab, WISC, Icube, Academia, and any collaborators that I can find through my past experiences. I would be happy to work with these societies to really bring Robotics to UTM, especially with the start of the Robotics institute! </p>
